# SiTani App Flow Document

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

When a brand-new user first comes across the SiTani application, they typically find it on the Google Play Store or receive a direct link from a trusted source. Tapping the app icon brings up a welcome screen with a brief introduction to SiTani’s smart farming features. From here, the user can choose to register a new account or sign in if they already have credentials. Registration requires the user to provide an email address, create a secure password, and enter their name and farm location. After submitting these details, the user sees a confirmation message and is taken directly to the Home Dashboard. If the user already has an account, they simply enter their email and password on the sign-in screen and tap “Log In.” The app validates the credentials against its authentication store and, on success, transitions to the Home Dashboard. If the user forgets their password, they can tap “Forgot Password,” enter their email address, and receive an email link to reset the password. Following the link lets them choose a new password and then return to the sign-in screen. Signing out is available in the settings menu, which immediately ends the session and returns the user to the welcome screen.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page

After a successful login, the user arrives at the Home Dashboard, which serves as the central hub of SiTani. At the top of the screen, a header bar displays the user’s name and a menu icon on the left. The menu icon opens a side panel containing links to Profile, Settings, and Log Out. Below the header, the user sees a weather card that automatically shows the current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and an icon representing today’s conditions. Under the weather card lies the daily to-do list. Each task is displayed in a scrollable list using a RecyclerView, showing the task name, scheduled time, and a checkbox to mark it complete. A floating action button in the lower right corner invites the user to add a new task. From the Home Dashboard, tapping any task takes the user to the Task Detail page for viewing or editing, while tapping the weather card opens a full weather details screen.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

When the user taps the floating action button on the Home Dashboard, the app smoothly transitions to the New Task screen. Here, the user enters a task title, description, and chooses a date and time for the reminder using date and time pickers. Saving the task writes it to the local Room database and schedules a notification through WorkManager. After saving, the app returns to the Home Dashboard and displays the new task in the list. To edit an existing task, the user taps it in the list, which opens the Task Detail screen. On that screen, the fields are populated with existing data and the user can change the title, description, or reminder time. Tapping “Update” applies changes to the database and reschedules the reminder if needed. A “Delete” option at the bottom of the Task Detail screen asks for confirmation before removing the task from the database and canceling any pending notifications. For weather updates, the user can pull down on the Home Dashboard to refresh. This triggers a Retrofit call to the OpenWeather API, and the UI updates with the latest weather information or shows a friendly message if the network is unavailable. If the user taps the weather card, they see a full-screen view with extended forecast details for the next few days. In the side panel, selecting “Profile” opens the Profile page. This screen displays the user’s name, email, and farm location in editable fields. Tapping “Save Profile” writes changes to local storage or a backend, then returns the user to the Home Dashboard. If the user opens the “Settings” link, they navigate to a Settings page where they can toggle notifications on or off, choose the default reminder time increment, and switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit. Settings changes take effect immediately and the user can return to the Home Dashboard by using the back arrow in the header.

## Settings and Account Management

The Settings page lets users manage how SiTani behaves. Here, the user sees switches for enabling or disabling notification reminders, as well as options to select temperature units. Below these options, a section for account management presents the user’s email (read-only) and allows them to update their password by entering the current and new passwords. There is also a Log Out button at the bottom of the Settings page that ends the session and sends the user back to the welcome screen. Changes to notification preferences and temperature units are saved locally so they persist between sessions. Whenever the user finishes updating settings, tapping the device back button or the header back arrow returns them to the Home Dashboard.

## Error States and Alternate Paths

Whenever the user enters an incorrect email or password at sign-in, the app displays a clear error message beneath the input fields stating “Invalid email or password. Please try again.” If there is no network when trying to refresh weather data, a banner appears on the Home Dashboard saying “Unable to fetch weather. Showing last known data.” If the Room database fails to write a new task, the user sees a toast message reading “Failed to save task. Please try again.” Input validation on the New Task screen prevents empty titles or missing reminder times by disabling the Save button until all required fields are filled. If scheduling a reminder fails, the app shows a dialog that says “Unable to set reminder,” and the user can retry or continue without a reminder. When the user tries to delete a task, a confirmation dialog ensures they do not accidentally lose data. If the user attempts to update their password and the current password does not match, the Settings page shows an inline error under the password field.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey

In summary, a new user discovers SiTani, installs it, and registers with their email and farm details. They then sign in to land on the Home Dashboard, where they instantly see the day’s weather and their to-do list. From there, they can add, edit, or delete tasks with reminders, refresh weather data, and view extended forecasts. They can manage their profile in the Profile page and adjust preferences in Settings, including toggling notifications and updating their password. Throughout the experience, clear messages guide them around errors and ensure tasks and reminders function reliably. By following this flow, farmers can sign up once, organize daily work, stay informed about weather, and receive timely reminders, making SiTani an essential smart farming assistant.
